# C++ Learning Examples

A collection of practical C++ examples demonstrating various programming concepts including variables, arithmetic operations, and formatted output.

## Features

- **Class Statistics**: Calculate total books needed for a class
- **Geometric Calculations**: Compute circle area using π
- **Temperature Conversion**: Convert between Fahrenheit and Celsius
- **Formatted Output**: Demonstrate clean console output formatting

## Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (GCC 4.9.0 or later recommended)
- Basic understanding of C++ syntax
- CMake (optional)

## Building the Project

### Using G++
```bash

# Run the program
./program
```

### Using CMake (Optional)
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Program Output Example

The program will display:
- Class statistics with student and book counts
- Circle calculations with area
- Temperature conversions between °F and °C
